## CTO Interview Q&A

### Q1: When a recruiter lands on your site, what 3–5 skills do you want them to remember?
A1:
Business strategy, data analytics, and financial analysis, with a strong emphasis on connecting data and finance to strategic business decision-making.

---

### Q2: What tools or methods have you actually used within those skill areas?
A2:
- Business Strategy: Created deliverables across different corporate functions during internships, including presentations and analyses used by stakeholders to support decision-making.
- Data Analytics: Used Power BI and Tableau to analyze datasets and build dashboards in research and internship settings.
- Financial Analysis: Applied financial concepts through coursework and internships using Microsoft 365 tools, including structured analysis and reporting.

---

### Q3: If you could only feature two pieces of proof on your site, what would they be and why?
A3:
- GE Vernova: Demonstrates real-world product and business strategy experience in a large, complex organization, including cross-functional collaboration and data-driven decision-making.
- Data Nova: Shows hands-on data analytics experience, including working with real datasets, building dashboards, and translating analysis into actionable insights for stakeholders.

---

### Q4: Who is the primary target audience for this site?
A4:
The primary audience is FinTech-focused business and technology consulting recruiters in NYC and New Jersey.  
If hired, I would help them solve problems related to data-driven decision-making, financial analysis, and translating analytics into strategic business insights.

---

### Q5: What should a recruiter understand within 5 seconds of landing on your site?
A5:
This person understands how data, finance, and business strategy connect.  
This reflects my strengths in data analytics, my growing passion for financial work, and my ability to translate both into strategic insights.

---

### Q6: What is your current comfort level with web development?
A6:
A/C hybrid — I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, but prefer keeping the site simple and static rather than using heavy frontend frameworks. My priority is clarity, speed, and reliability over complexity.

---

### Q7: What constraints matter most for this project, and how will recruiters view the site?
A7:
Top priorities are visual polish and long-term scalability.  
Recruiters will primarily view the site on laptops or desktop screens.

---

### Q8: What is the initial call-to-action you believe fits this site?
A8:
The initial idea was to prioritize scheduling a short introductory call, with viewing GitHub contributions as a secondary action. This was based on the belief that understanding the person behind the work is as important as the work itself.

---

### Q9: What visual tone should the site have?
A9:
Primary tone: Clean and corporate.  
Secondary tone: Modern and tech-forward.  
After scrolling once, a recruiter should perceive me as professional, credible, and capable of operating in technical, business-focused environments.

---

### Q10: What is the final decision for the site’s call-to-action after evaluating recruiter behavior?
A10:
Final decision:
- Primary CTA: “Request My Technical Resume”
- Secondary CTA: “View My GitHub Contributions”

This decision balances professionalism and recruiter behavior by reducing friction and prioritizing fast access to credentials, while still enabling deeper engagement later.

---

## Debate / Pivot

The AI initially suggested prioritizing more complex frontend tooling and using direct scheduling of introductory calls as the primary CTA.  
I challenged this approach by emphasizing recruiter accessibility, speed of deployment, and alignment with real recruiter workflows.  

Final decision: build a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript site deployed via GitHub Pages, with a resume-request CTA to reduce friction while maintaining a professional tone.
