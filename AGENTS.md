# AGENTS.md — Master Implementation Letter

## The Mandate
**Target Outcome:** Secure technical and product-focused internship and early-career roles by showcasing data-driven projects, real-world product experience, and strategic thinking to NYC and NJ recruiters (FinTech-focused business/tech consulting + analytics).

## The Tech Stack (and Why)
- **HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript:** Fastest, cleanest path to a professional portfolio with zero framework overhead. Easy to maintain and easy for recruiters to load instantly.
- **Git + GitHub:** Version control + visible proof of work.
- **GitHub Pages:** Simple, recruiter-friendly hosting with a stable public URL.

(Optional later)
- **Formspree (or similar):** If we want a real lead-gen form without backend code.

## The Sitemap
1. **Hero (Above the Fold)**
   - One-line positioning statement (data + finance + strategy)
   - Primary CTA button: **Request My Technical Resume**
   - Secondary CTA link/button: **View My GitHub Contributions**

2. **Case Studies / Proof**
   - **GE Vernova** (product/business strategy + data-driven decisions)
   - **Data Nova** (data analytics + dashboards + insights)
   - (Optional) 1 academic/project highlight if needed

3. **Skills Snapshot**
   - Data analytics tools (Power BI, Tableau)
   - Business/finance analysis
   - Communication & stakeholder work
   - Microsoft 365 certification

4. **Leadership & Impact**
   - Student leadership / involvement (short and credible)

5. **Lead-Gen / Contact**
   - Short form or email capture
   - Clear text: “For recruiting inquiries: request my resume”
   - Backup: a mailto link if form tooling isn’t used

## Non-Negotiables
- **Mobile responsive** (works on phones, tablets, laptops)
- **Fast load** (no heavy frameworks)
- **SEO optimized for NJ/NY**:
  - Keywords to include naturally: “NJIT”, “NYC”, “New Jersey”, “FinTech”, “data analytics”, “business strategy”, “financial analysis”, “Power BI”, “Tableau”
- **Clear CTA within 5 seconds**
  - Primary: **Request My Technical Resume**
- **Professional vibe** (clean, corporate, modern)
- **Accessibility basics** (semantic HTML, readable text, contrast)

## Build Rule
Scaffold the file structure first. Do not implement content/logic until the structure is approved.
